During the research phase, we were challenged to find subject matter experts in the field. We didnâ€™t have access to forensic examiners who were not existing customers, and so we took it upon ourselves to conduct own sleuthing and search through online forums, LinkedIn groups, and blogs related to digital forensics and incident response for examiners to share their thoughts. We also recruited respondents from these forums to survey their feedback and opinion on the product landscape. The recruitment time took longer than expected, and so we ended our research with two external survey responses, two subject matter experts from Magnet Forensics, and one interview with an existing customer of Magnet Forensics. In addition, Magnet Forensics provided us with over thirty survey responses and customer interviews that were conducted prior to the start of the project.
