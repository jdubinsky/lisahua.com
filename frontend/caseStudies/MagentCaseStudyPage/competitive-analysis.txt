The market for forensic software is very technical and niche. There are international players in this field from Germany, Israel, and the United States that are producing products that aid forensic examiners investigators. The team at Magnet Forensics shared their own research on their product and helped us piece together an image of what the market was lacking. What helped Magnet Forensics stand out was their unique founder’s story as a former police officer and their dedication to helping investigators solve crime around the world. The competitive landscape consisted primarily one uni-tasker type of tools; they were very good at doing one aspect of the job, such as extracting the most information from cellphones. This type of mentality made it difficult for Magnet Forensics to position itself as a cross-platform tool as many forensic examiners were accustomed to using an average of seven to twelve products. From the our own research, we found a similar sentiment amongst the userbase. Many forensic examiners weren’t keen on replacing any of their favourite tools with an expensive one that claimed to do it all.
