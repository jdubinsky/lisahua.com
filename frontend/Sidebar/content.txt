I currently work as a User experience designer at Crowdlinker conducting user interviews and desiging web experiences that are intuitive, accessible, and delightful.

I've previously studied landscape architecture. I apply design thinking and experience to solve both real and future user needs. I take a colloborate approach to design with other members of my team to create these experiences.
