The marketing team were having difficulties updating content on the site
 and needed a site that is WCAG AA compliant due to their consumer base.
 Our team worked closely with theirs to deliver a project on a tight deadline.
`;

export const research = `
After meeting with eSight, we began piecing together an image of the market.
 The research objectives focused on three main personas: those with visual impairments,
 a loved one who knows someone with a visual impairment, and opthamologists or vision
 professionals whose patients have visual impairments. We wanted to understand how the
 website can convey a sense of trustworthiness and the effectiveness of the product.
`;

export const infoArchitecture = `
Based on the client’s requirements and what we found from the research process we decided
 to design multiple journeys on the website, one for eSight users and one for vision professionals.
 Designing for the different needs and frustrations of our personas we created a list of questions
 each persona had and how we could answer it on the site.
 
The site was divided into five major sections, the product, learning centre, vision professionals,
 eMPOWER, and about the company.

Colour usage was very important to the overall design. eSight has a colourful palette of colours
 that represent different things to their brand; passionate, energetic, compassion.
 I used the Stark plugin while designing and double checked colour and font choices with
 WebAIM contrast checker to ensure that the CTAs met accessibility requirements.
 The font sizes for the CTAs were increased to 19px to ensure that the orange and white met
 AA colour contrast of 3:1.
 
We also tested the site with automated accessibility checkers like
 aXe to catch issues such as missing alt text, and that the headings followed a logical order from H1 to H5.
 Alongside the developer, I manually tested sections of the site with VoiceOver for
 Mac on Google Chrome and Safari to ensure that interactive elements like toggles, buttons,
 and checkboxes were being read correctly by the assistive technology.

The site was built from various components that allowed the eSight team the flexibility
 to create as many blocks of content as they needed.
`;

export const results = `
The site was tested with six of eSight’s team of coaches, all of whom have varying
 visual impairments. Based on their suggestions, we made adjustments to elements on
 the page such as removing the auto-playing carousel and using darker colours in the CTAs.
 We also included optional accessibility tools on the top-left corner that offer additional
 controls to the site such as increasing text size, high contrast mode, and
 underlining links for more visibility.
