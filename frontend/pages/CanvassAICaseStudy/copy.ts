The original product was quickly built by their development to
test their product’s viability, and they approached Crowdlinker
to address their usability issues and revamp the overall experience.
Canvass AI provided us a demo environment that allowed us to play around with their product.

Alongside the lead designer and PM, I worked on the wireframes,
user flow, and high fidelity designs which were delivered to
Canvass AI’s development team to build. We worked closely with
the CEO, CTO, and their lead developer as subject matter experts.
The resulting prototype we created was intended to be used in their investor pitches.
`;

export const wireframes = `
Forty screens were designed which included flows like account management for
admin users, uploading datasets to train the predictors, and a dashboard view
with various graph options available for the business analyst role.
`;

export const userFlow = `
I created a user flow that helped our team visualize the web application at
a broader scale; this helped the PM to create user stories and make adjustments
to the JIRA tickets as new feedback came up in our meetings.
`;

export const highFidelityPartOne = `
To keep with Canvass AI’s visual presence, I balanced the clean aesthetic of
white space with the need to display large datasets and tables on each screen.
Shades of white and minimal drop shadows are used throughout the design to emphasize
visual elements in focus, and I reserved bright visual colours for status alerts
that needed the user’s attention.
`;

export const highFidelityPartTwo = `
The designs were iterated on several times over the course of the project;
we wanted to stay true to the brand’s purple colour, but we suggested a
brighter gradient that complemented the modern aesthetic we were striving for.
The use of the purple colour was narrowed down to primary CTAs to ensure that it was not overused.
`;

export const results = `
We delivered the final designs, style guide and an annotated user flow to
the Canvass AI team, as well as a fully clickable prototype that they could
use to demo in their pitches. In the coming months after project completion,
we received word that Canvass AI successfully raised $5M USD led by
Gradient Ventures, Google’s AI fund.
