Part of my job at Crowdlinker is to help brainstorm ideas for prospective clients;
 design sprints, wireframe mockups, or generate visual designs.
 OnCall came to us looking for a new website strategy that would
 put them ahead of other virtual medicine competitors like Maple
 and Appletree Medical. Due to the nature of pitches, this project
 had a very quick turn around before it was put in front of the client
 during a meeting, but I managed to use their existing branding copy and
 material and created a journey that spoke to OnCall’s three primary value
 propositions.

As part of the pitch, I championed a new visual identity for the brand.
 I picked a calming shade of green as the primary colour to create a
 playful palette that is clean. It pairs nicely with the soft beige that
 adds warmth to their branding and makes the experience feel a lot more inviting.
 Their previous brand identity is very technical and clinical in look and feel.
 However I didn’t want OnCall to lose their history, and so I included a muted
 blue shade as a complementary colour to the green.

Since OnCall’s product is in
 the digital space, it lacks the opportunities for in-person experiences that doctor’s
 clinics traditionally have. Photography choice played an important role in establishing
 a strong personal connection while remaining professional and friendly to businesses who
 would be interested in using OnCall’s platform in their practices.

OnCall is currently working with Crowdlinker to a new redesign of their branding at this time.
