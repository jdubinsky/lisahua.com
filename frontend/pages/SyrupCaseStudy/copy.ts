SYRUP is a unique content platform designed to connect fans
 with their favorite athletes and consume content that
 focuses on sports, music, entertainment and culture in Toronto.
`;

export const context = `
MLSE had been working on creating a brand new channel for
 fan engagement called SYRUP with branding agency SidLee.
 After the Toronto Raptors won their first NBA Championship,
 Crowdlinker had the opportunity to design and develop the experience
 for this product. I was part of the design sprint team that
 brainstormed product ideas for SYRUP. They challenged us to think
 of ways of utilizing their large amounts of content to engage their fans
 outside of the arena and help extend the momentum for the Raptor’s win.
`;

export const designSprint = `
Due to the short time frame to impress the client,
 our team opted to conduct a design sprint in which a team of designers,
 product managers, and developers sat together in a room to rapidly brainstorm,
 design, and test the validity of our ideas.
`;

export const designSprintCaption = `
We followed Google’s five day design sprint and came up
 with multiple journeys that we designed and rapidly prototyped.

  "Fans want to learn more about the team’s or player’s lifestyle.",
  "Fans are mainly local to Toronto. How might we create new global fanbases in non-traditional areas?",
  "Not all fans can take part in the “buzz” at Jurassic Park and those around the country. How can we engage the casual fan and involve them?",
  "The Championship Parade does not maintain its momentum year round, how can we change that?",
  "How might we showcase the blended identity of the city for all users of the product?",
];
export const insightsListTwoTitle =
  "We also extracted the following insights from our research and grouped them into four major themes:";
export const insightsListTwo = [
  "Gamification - engage with other people on the platform through challenges and ascend levels to unlock new experiences",
  "Constant return to engage - Compel users to keep coming back with “the drip” and allow them to redeem their points immediately",
  "Unique Content - access to content that can’t be found on YouTube or social media, with exclusive insights into the lifestyle of players and coaches",
  "Subscription - How can we use a freemium model as a business strategy?",
];

export const concepts = `
Our mission statement for SYRUP was to create global life-long fans
 by breaking conventions and continue engagement with personalized content.
`;

export const conceptsParagraph = `
Throughout the sprint, we created two different concepts we dubbed “Fan 2 Fan” and “Fan 2 Organization”. I worked on the Fan2Organization experience, designing the high-fidelity screens and Invision prototype.
Fan 2 Fan focuses on creating an online community of “casual bandwagon fans” and “athletic-oriented” users. In this experience, users could participate in sports challenges to earn points. Likewise, they could use the platform to find local events near them such as watching the game or pickup games.

On the other hand, Fan 2 Organization looks to expand sports culture and bring fans closer to the athletes and humanize them. This experience is for “die-hard fans” who are curious to learn different things about their favorite athletes or coaches such as their workout routines, diets, and watch daily content about the teams. We also explored the idea of fostering the “next-generation” of fans, with programs that engage and foster a healthy interest in professional sports.

export const outcomes = `
After presenting the deck, MLSE officially signed on and greenlighted the project.
 The first phase of the project, dubbed “observe”, focuses on experiences that
 allow users to view and consume content, whether it is a video, audio, or text.
 SYRUP was to be built in an agile manner; every week a new section of the
 application was designed, presented to the MLSE team, and then handed over to
 development to start right away.
`;

export const design = `
During this time, I was leading a different project and so I was not involved with
 SYRUP during the early parts of the design phase. The lead designer, Graham McFie,
 built upon the visual language created by SidLee and put together the user flow,
 usability testing, and the basis for the home and dribble content.
 I joined the project again about half-way through the project and made adjustments based on
 client feedback, tweaked areas for consistency, and designed new sections of the platform.
`;

export const results = `Two fully clickable prototypes for both desktop and mobile were delivered to the MLSE team, as well as a beta version of the site was available on a staging link. I created an annotated document that outlined the features of the application and their usage, to ensure that MLSE’s team understood how each element could be interacted with or the type of animation it would have.

MLSE’s team loved the work we had done and presented it to their executive team. They are now in the process of generating content and announced the launch of SYRUP in March 2020, with plans of opening it to the public. Crowdlinker is currently waiting for the greenlight from the MLSE team to move ahead with the next phases of the project.
