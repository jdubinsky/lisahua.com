The market for forensic software is extremely narrow and technical. There are international companies from Germany, Israel, and the United States that are developing products for  forensic examiners. The team at Magnet Forensics shared their competitive research and shared their product roadmap. They were looking to disrupt the industry by reducing the bottleneck on forensic investigations - the forensic examiners’ lack of time.

The market consisted primarily of uni-tasker type of tools. They were very good at one aspect of the investigation, such as extracting the most information from cell phones. From my own research I found a vocal majority of forensic examiners weren’t keen on replacing any of their favourites with a more expensive, multi-purpose tool. Many forensic examiners were accustomed to using anywhere between seven to twelve products.
