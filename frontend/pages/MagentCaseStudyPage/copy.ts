export const description = `
Redesigning the experience of buying and training investigative forensic equipment.
`;

export const goals = `
During our initial discovery session, we identified the following goals for the website:
`;

export const goalsList = [
  "Help users understand the differences between their previous product (Magnet IEF) and their new offerings (Magnet AXIOM and beyond)",
  "Improve the “Book A Demo” user flow",
  "Organize resources in a way that made it easy to find and use for existing users",
];

export const additionalGoals = `
And after speaking with our stakeholders, we uncovered additional goals that would roll up to the primary objectives.
`;

export const additionalGoalsList = [
  "Create different journeys to help users find the product offering that suited their needs.",
  "Get the appropriate training to use the tools in their workflow",
];

export const context = `
Magnet Forensics is a software company that develops products
used in investigations by governing agencies and private corporations.
At the time, Magnet Forensics had already built their new best-in-class product,
Magnet AXIOM, and were in the process of developing a complementing
suite of products to grow beyond their niche role in the industry.
They faced issues with customers who were already familiar with their
previous product and didn’t see the value in buying a new suite of tools.
`;

export const problem = `
Like many other scale-ups, Magnet Forensics had outgrown their website:
 resources were all over the place and difficult to find,
 there were too many products on the website, and they had multiple stakeholders
 trying to achieve different goals at the same time.
`;

export const competitiveAnalysis = `
The market for forensic software is extremely narrow and technical.
 There are international companies from Germany, Israel, and the
 United States that are developing products for  forensic examiners.
 The team at Magnet Forensics shared their competitive research and
 shared their product roadmap. They were looking to disrupt the industry
 by reducing the bottleneck on forensic investigations -
 the forensic examiners’ lack of time.

The market consisted primarily of uni-tasker type of tools.
 They were very good at one aspect of the investigation,
 such as extracting the most information from cell phones.
 From my own research I found a vocal majority of forensic
 examiners weren’t keen on replacing any of their favourites
 with a more expensive, multi-purpose tool. Many forensic
 examiners were accustomed to using anywhere between seven to twelve products.
`;

export const stakeholderInterviews = `
We organized in-person interviews to speak to key stakeholders at
 Magnet Forensics including: the VP of Training, the VP of Corporate Affairs,
 the VP of Product Management, an Account Executive, a senior member from Customer Support,
 the founder and CTO and the CEO. Speaking to these groups helped develop
 the project’s goals and strategy.
`;

export const challenges = `
During the research phase, the product manager and I were challenged
 to find subject matter experts in the field. We didn’t have access to
 users who weren’t existing customers, and so we took it upon ourselves
 to conduct some internet sleuthing for forensic examiners.
 I joined online forums, LinkedIn groups, and followed blogs related to
 digital forensics and incident response. I found respondents from these
 forums and created a survey to capture their opinion on the product landscape.

The recruitment time took longer than expected, and so we ended our research
 with two external survey responses, two subject matter experts from Magnet Forensics,
 and one interview with an existing customer of Magnet Forensics.
 Magnet Forensics also provided us with over thirty survey responses
 and customer interviews that were conducted prior to the start of the project.
`;

export const define = `
As we were collecting information, I began organizing knowledge
into three categories: user types, satisfaction with product, and
competitors. In doing so, I was able to fully flesh out an ideal
customer for Magnet Forensics; what inspires and motivates them,
how Magnet Forensics’ was portrayed in their customers’ eyes, and
what it was that their competitors were doing that users responded
well to.
`;

export const examiner = `
  This is Raymond, a fictional Forensic Examiner. He’s extremely detail-oriented and has a backlog of over forty
  devices he needs to process. Each one could take anywhere between two to eight hours to do manually, depending
  on the complexity of the case and the information that he needed to find. But a colleague of his mentioned
  Magnet AXIOM, so he’s looking for a way to get a free trial. He’s looking for something that fits into his
  existing workflow and reduces his workload.
`;

export const policeLeader = `
  Scott represents the chain of command within a police organization and a decision maker in the purchasing
  decision. While forensic examiners like Raymond can influence their organization from the bottom-up, Magnet
  Forensics wanted to cater to police leaders who were responsible for organization-wide decisions. Their
  existing customers include the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice.
`;

export const policeAdvisor = `
  This user group was especially difficult to find interviewees, however we were fortunate enough to be put in
  contact with a police advisor. He previously consulted with the Peel Regional Police and spoke to some of the
  pain points that police leaders faced. Their needs were vastly different than the Forensic Examiner; they
  weren’t involved in investigations, but they were concerned on their organizations performance metrics such as
  crime solve rate and resource allocation.
`;

export const investigator = `
  Charles is the Investigator - a persona that didn’t immediately surface during my research. During the
  stakeholder interviews, our team learned about Magnet Forensics’ intention to launch a new suite of tools
  designed for investigators. The investigators are in charge of leading the investigation; they coordinate
  between different parties and assign tasks to Forensic Examiners. This persona would be interested in Magnet
  Forensics’ expanded products which doesn’t require certification to use like Magnet AXIOM, but shifts the
  chain of command towards an asynchronous model where Forensic Examiners could automate their workflow and
  report their progress in an effective manner.
`;

export const journeyMapping = `
  I created customer journey maps of the existing site for the different personas and printed them out and
  pinned them to the wall to make it easier to review in a meeting. This made it easier for the team to get
  together and analyze each step in the journey; where were users dropping off, where was information being
  duplicated? Each persona was looking for something different from the website and it helped jump-start the
  team to think about the way information was organized on the site.
`;

export const ideate = `
After reporting our findings to Magnet Forensics, the team was
confident that the client’s goals were aligned with the strategy
we wanted to move forward with. Magnet Forensics, both their
product offering and website wanted to focus on shifting their
messaging to cater to the decision makers in an organization, the
leadership roles who are less interested in the technical aspects
of the product, but the results it can deliver. At the time,
Magnet AXIOM was the primary tool, and we came up with ways to its
product page.
`;

export const retro = `
Working on a project whose mission is to “Seek Justice and Protect
The Innocent” has taught me a lot about empathy and the value in
allowing users to have autonomy on the type of content they want
to see. In the conversations we had, we learned that while the
subject matter of their job isn’t always pleasant, our users are
expected to be absolutely confident in their skills, which has
positive and negative effects on their decision making process
when purchasing tools for their investigation.
`;

export const retroList = [
  "Click throughs to “Try Magnet AXIOM” increased from 2470 pre-launch to 2978 post-launch",
  "Increased time-on-page on both the blog and resources.",
];

export const nextSteps = `
  While our initial project scope only extended as far as the marketing website, we plan to observe the site’s
  health and continually engage with Magnet Forensics to improve site performance and usability. Given more time
  and resources, I’d like to incorporate in-depth research practices in the discovery such as conducting field
  studies and conducting open card sorting exercises to better categorize engaging content such as resources and
  blog posts.
`;

export const research = `
At the start of this project, I had no idea about the type of
things that would happen during an investigation. I made it my
goal to learn everything I possibly could in the life of a
forensic examiner- the good, the bad, and the ugly.
`;

export const approach = `
I joined the project as the UX designer, and my involvement spanned across the discovery phase.
`;

export const approachResearch = `
I conducted stakeholder interviews, recruited users and wrote screeners and surveys, created personas.
`;

export const synthesis = `
Working with the Product Manager, I synthesized the research findings to develop a strategy for the website.
We mapped out customer journeys and from there I built the site’s information architecture, created wireframes
and iterated on the concepts to ensure it aligned with the business’ goals.
`;

export const testing = `
We began testing the wireframes with existing users, and used their feedback to iterate on the website’s
experience on desktop and mobile devices.
`;

export const interviews = `
We recruited an existing customer of Magnet Forensics and sent out surveys to forensic examiners we recruited
via forum posts. Our objective was to develop our understanding of the product market, the types of
investigations they typically worked on, and how willing they were to try something new.

Based on our interviews, we learned the following about the forensic examiner and their role in their company:
`;

export const interviewsList = [
  "They’re accustomed to using free and open-source tools instead of automation",
  "There is a lack of funding and time available for Forensic examiners to undertake training, especially for in-person courses",
  `They were not the primary decision maker in the product purchase; they would submit requests for any new
   tools or training and had to make their case to their managers`,
  "Leadership roles in the public sector often had a budget to spend every year; a “use it or lose it” type of policy",
];

export const infoArch = `
  We tailored the journey to suit the three persona types identified in our research. Our approach to this was
  designing dedicated solutions pages that each persona could self-identify with and find the appropriate tool
  for their skill level and job requirements. By doing so, we helped reduce decision fatigue from the users,
  especially the leadership roles, who didn’t have the time to go through Magnet Forensics’ entire product line.
`;

export const wireframes = `
  I created forty-three screens that covered the primary functions of the website including: the home, product
  overview, and product landing pages, solutions pages, start a free trial, and the blog & resource centre.
`;

export const usabilityTesting = `
  Using an Invision prototype, we conducted three usability tests with recruited participants with varying
  degrees of knowledge of Magnet AXIOM. Participants were instructed to complete four common tasks, with the
  goal of evaluating the user’s understanding of the information architecture.
`;

export const usabilityTestingList = [
  `The content in the prototype did not effectively address Magnet AXIOM’s ability to perform smart phone
   investigations.`,
];

export const afterUsabilityTesting = `
  After testing, I created a report that summarized the results of the testing and the recommendations to
  improve the user flow. I went back to adjust the wireframes and placed higher emphasis on smart phones by
  following an “F” shaped pattern and moved the smart phone tab on the left-hand side. I also included a section
  on the home page about smart phone investigations with a related customer story as social proof.
