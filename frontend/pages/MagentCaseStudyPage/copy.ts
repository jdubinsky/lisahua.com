Previously, I worked at Crowdlinker conducting user interviews and designing
 web experiences that are intuitive and accessible for everyone.
 There I worked alongside a fantastic team of developers, product managers,
 QA interns, and clients to create successful products.

export const problem = `
Like many other scale-ups, Magnet Forensics had outgrown their website:
 resources were all over the place and difficult to find,
 there were too many products on the website, and they had multiple stakeholders
 trying to achieve different goals at the same time.

export const competitiveAnalysis = `
The market for forensic software is extremely narrow and technical.
 There are international companies from Germany, Israel, and the
 United States that are developing products for  forensic examiners.
 The team at Magnet Forensics shared their competitive research and
 shared their product roadmap. They were looking to disrupt the industry
 by reducing the bottleneck on forensic investigations -
 the forensic examiners’ lack of time.

The market consisted primarily of uni-tasker type of tools.
 They were very good at one aspect of the investigation,
 such as extracting the most information from cell phones.
 From my own research I found a vocal majority of forensic
 examiners weren’t keen on replacing any of their favourites
 with a more expensive, multi-purpose tool. Many forensic
 examiners were accustomed to using anywhere between seven to twelve products.

We organized in-person interviews to speak to key stakeholders at
 Magnet Forensics including: the VP of Training, the VP of Corporate Affairs,
 the VP of Product Management, an Account Executive, a senior member from Customer Support,
 the founder and CTO and the CEO. Speaking to these groups helped develop
 the project’s goals and strategy.

export const challenges = `
During the research phase, the product manager and I were challenged
 to find subject matter experts in the field. We didn’t have access to
 users who weren’t existing customers, and so we took it upon ourselves
 to conduct some internet sleuthing for forensic examiners.
 I joined online forums, LinkedIn groups, and followed blogs related to
 digital forensics and incident response. I found respondents from these
 forums and created a survey to capture their opinion on the product landscape.

The recruitment time took longer than expected, and so we ended our research
 with two external survey responses, two subject matter experts from Magnet Forensics,
 and one interview with an existing customer of Magnet Forensics.
 Magnet Forensics also provided us with over thirty survey responses
 and customer interviews that were conducted prior to the start of the project.
