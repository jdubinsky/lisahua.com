Redesigning the experience of buying and training investigative forensic equipment.
`;

export const context = `
Magnet Forensics is a software company that develops products
used in investigations by governing agencies and private corporations.
At the time, Magnet Forensics had already built their new best-in-class product,
Magnet AXIOM, and were in the process of developing a complementing
suite of products to grow beyond their niche role in the industry.
They faced issues with customers who were already familiar with their
previous product and didn’t see the value in buying a new suite of tools.
`;

export const problem = `
Like many other scale-ups, Magnet Forensics had outgrown their website:
 resources were all over the place and difficult to find,
 there were too many products on the website, and they had multiple stakeholders
 trying to achieve different goals at the same time.
`;

export const competitiveAnalysis = `
The market for forensic software is extremely narrow and technical.
 There are international companies from Germany, Israel, and the
 United States that are developing products for  forensic examiners.
 The team at Magnet Forensics shared their competitive research and
 shared their product roadmap. They were looking to disrupt the industry
 by reducing the bottleneck on forensic investigations -
 the forensic examiners’ lack of time.

The market consisted primarily of uni-tasker type of tools.
 They were very good at one aspect of the investigation,
 such as extracting the most information from cell phones.
 From my own research I found a vocal majority of forensic
 examiners weren’t keen on replacing any of their favourites
 with a more expensive, multi-purpose tool. Many forensic
 examiners were accustomed to using anywhere between seven to twelve products.
`;

export const stakeholderInterviews = `
We organized in-person interviews to speak to key stakeholders at
 Magnet Forensics including: the VP of Training, the VP of Corporate Affairs,
 the VP of Product Management, an Account Executive, a senior member from Customer Support,
 the founder and CTO and the CEO. Speaking to these groups helped develop
 the project’s goals and strategy.
`;

export const challenges = `
During the research phase, the product manager and I were challenged
 to find subject matter experts in the field. We didn’t have access to
 users who weren’t existing customers, and so we took it upon ourselves
 to conduct some internet sleuthing for forensic examiners.
 I joined online forums, LinkedIn groups, and followed blogs related to
 digital forensics and incident response. I found respondents from these
 forums and created a survey to capture their opinion on the product landscape.

The recruitment time took longer than expected, and so we ended our research
 with two external survey responses, two subject matter experts from Magnet Forensics,
 and one interview with an existing customer of Magnet Forensics.
 Magnet Forensics also provided us with over thirty survey responses
 and customer interviews that were conducted prior to the start of the project.
`;

export const define = `
As we were collecting information, I began organizing knowledge
into three categories: user types, satisfaction with product, and
competitors. In doing so, I was able to fully flesh out an ideal
customer for Magnet Forensics; what inspires and motivates them,
how Magnet Forensics’ was portrayed in their customers’ eyes, and
what it was that their competitors were doing that users responded
well to.
`;

export const ideate = `
After reporting our findings to Magnet Forensics, the team was
confident that the client’s goals were aligned with the strategy
we wanted to move forward with. Magnet Forensics, both their
product offering and website wanted to focus on shifting their
messaging to cater to the decision makers in an organization, the
leadership roles who are less interested in the technical aspects
of the product, but the results it can deliver. At the time,
Magnet AXIOM was the primary tool, and we came up with ways to its
product page.

Working on a project whose mission is to “Seek Justice and Protect
The Innocent” has taught me a lot about empathy and the value in
allowing users to have autonomy on the type of content they want
to see. In the conversations we had, we learned that while the
subject matter of their job isn’t always pleasant, our users are
expected to be absolutely confident in their skills, which has
positive and negative effects on their decision making process
when purchasing tools for their investigation.
`;

export const research = `
At the start of this project, I had no idea about the type of
things that would happen during an investigation. I made it my
goal to learn everything I possibly could in the life of a
forensic examiner- the good, the bad, and the ugly.
`;

export const approach = `
I joined the project as the UX designer, and my involvement spanned across the discovery phase.
`;

export const approachResearch = `
I conducted stakeholder interviews, recruited users and wrote screeners and surveys, created personas.
`;

export const synthesis = `
Working with the Product Manager, I synthesized the research findings to develop a strategy for the website.
We mapped out customer journeys and from there I built the site’s information architecture, created wireframes
and iterated on the concepts to ensure it aligned with the business’ goals.
`;

export const testing = `
We began testing the wireframes with existing users, and used their feedback to iterate on the website’s
experience on desktop and mobile devices.
`;

export const interviews = `
We recruited an existing customer of Magnet Forensics and sent out surveys to forensic examiners we recruited
via forum posts. Our objective was to develop our understanding of the product market, the types of
investigations they typically worked on, and how willing they were to try something new.

Based on our interviews, we learned the following about the forensic examiner and their role in their company:
