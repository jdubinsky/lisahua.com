During the research phase, the product manager and I were challenged to find subject matter experts in the field. We didn’t have access to users who weren’t existing customers, and so we took it upon ourselves to conduct some internet sleuthing for forensic examiners. I joined online forums, LinkedIn groups, and followed blogs related to digital forensics and incident response. I found respondents from these forums and created a survey to capture their opinion on the product landscape.

The recruitment time took longer than expected, and so we ended our research with two external survey responses, two subject matter experts from Magnet Forensics, and one interview with an existing customer of Magnet Forensics. Magnet Forensics also provided us with over thirty survey responses and customer interviews that were conducted prior to the start of the project.
