I currently work at Crowdlinker conducting user interviews
 and designing web experiences that are intuitive and accessible for everyone.

I've previously studied landscape architecture and learned
 how to apply strategic thinking that addresses user needs
 with the productâ€™s future in mind. I work alongside a fantastic
 team of developers, product managers, QA interns and clients
 to create a successful product.
